Conceptual description

I'm a frequent glider over at Ed Levins national park and though there's not much to be added in terms of design. I thought of an emergency manuever system adding very little weight to the body of the glider.

The idea is to have a sensor (initially i was thinking a Sonar) to activate quick transitional manuevers to avoid any obstacles. 2 sensors would work together for transitioning left and right and the remaining sensor works to control the forward and backwards transition.



Technical descripltion

The idea is an automous gliding steering system intended to detect hazards (incoming long-distance hazards) and enable a mechanism to pull and steer the wing into the proper direction. It uses 2 ultrasonic sensors on each side to detect incoming obstacles and activates a wrench wire system connected to the harness by pulling the body of the pilot in their programmed sides. Along the front of the glider is an additional sensor (infrared) in case uses of emergency stalling when landing. 

The wire system uses variable adjustment depending on the object's distance as the sensor reads. The sensors activate an LED strip, attached to the control bar of the glider and is there to assist in making you properly alerted. Sensors also activate audio, up to the very closest distance of an upcoming obstacle, an emergency sound activates. A laser would be attached to an area to allow proper calibration of the front sensor, which would require 2 or 3 hands. Battery source is portable.

When left sensor picks up object, right wrench activates and moves body right.
When right sensor picks up object, left wrrench activates and moves body left.
When front sensor activates, front and rear motor activate. Control bar moves forward, body moves backward.

This system uses:
2 ultrasonic sensors
1 infrared sensor
4 DC motors
4 retractable wire discs
laser and battery
