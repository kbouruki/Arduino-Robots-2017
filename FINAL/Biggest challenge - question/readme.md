As you could see from my final code, I did not manage to write the code for an smooth transitional DC motor PWM action in coordination with the distance reader.
Instead I used a analogWrite function code that activates everytime the distance reaches a certain number.

I did try to expand on the option you suggested, but I don't think I did it correctly.
The code compiled correctly, the voltage/connections were correct.

Ill attach 2 scans. In blue is what you wrote. In other colors are how I tried to elaborate but it did not work.


Refer to "code I tried"
In the "code I tried", is the mistake, I'm just not sure where.
